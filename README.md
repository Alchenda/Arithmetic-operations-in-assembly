# Arithmetic-operations-in-assembly
This project goes through some basic arithmetic in assembly, as well as some register management. The basis of this project is for students to become familiar with the MPLAB IDE and obsereve arithmetic/assembly commands.
Attached is a makeFile that can be used for compilation, although it is highly suggested to run the code in an environment that can handle the MIPS programming langauge, that way during compilation you are able to manually monitor register values.
